Created a blog using ruby on rails following the tutorial on Jumpstartlab for the Odin project. There were some elements of the tutorial that I didn't much like so I ended up doing things differently in places. I used active storage with minimagick and imagemagick rather than paperclip to make it a lot easier to upload multiple images. Authentication is also different, where an admin account can access everything, however everyone can create their own account. This means users can write their own articles and comments, and only the user (and admin) can edit or delete these articles and comments.
