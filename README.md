## About
This app was created following the tutorial on [Jumpstartlab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html). 

There were some elements in the tutorial that I didn't really like so I ended up doing things differently in places.

I used active storage with minimagick and imagemagick rather than paperclip to make it a lot easier to upload multiple images.

Authentication was also implemented differently, where an admin account can access everything, however every user can create their own account. This means users can write their own articles and comments, and only the user (and admin) can edit or delete these articles and comments.
